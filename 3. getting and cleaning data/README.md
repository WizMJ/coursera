### About Project

The project is required to submit: 

1) a tidy data set as described below,
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
4) a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

### About `run_analysis.R`

Programming is made by following activities

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Execution

- source(*run_anlaysis.R*)
- For details about project overall, see README.md
- For details about variables, see CodeBook.md
